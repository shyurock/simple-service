# Simple Service

## Overview

[**Replace this with a concise description of what the simple-service does.**]

This service is built using Spring Boot and provides [**mention key features or functionalities**]. It leverages reactive programming with Spring Webflux and uses MongoDB for data persistence.

## Features

*   [**List the key features of your service**]
*   [**Example: User authentication and authorization**]
*   [**Example: Media management**]
*   [**Example: Exposes a REST API for ...**]
*   [**Example: Uses Spring Security**]
*   [**Example: Uses Spring Session**]

## Technologies Used

*   **Spring Boot:**  Provides the foundation for building the application.
*   **Spring Webflux:** Enables reactive programming for handling requests.
*   **Spring Data MongoDB Reactive:**  Provides reactive data access to MongoDB.
*   **Spring Security:** Handles authentication and authorization.
*   **Spring Session:** Manages user sessions.
*   **Springdoc OpenAPI:**  Generates OpenAPI documentation for the API.
*   **Groovy:** Used as the primary language.
*   **Micrometer:**  Provides metrics for monitoring (Prometheus registry).
*   **Testcontainers:** Used for integration testing with MongoDB.
*   **JUnit Jupiter:** Used for unit and integration testing.
*   **Reactor Test:** Used for testing reactive components.

## Modules

The project is structured into the following modules:

*   `:module:user`: [**Describe the purpose of the user module**]
*   `:module:media`: This module handles the management of media files in the system. It provides functionality for
    uploading, storing, and retrieving various media assets such as images, videos, documents, and audio files. It
    includes features for file validation, format conversion, compression, and secure storage with appropriate access
*  # UI Module

The UI module delivers a sophisticated user interface for the simple-service app leveraging:

## Core Technologies

* **Vue.js** - Powers our reactive, component-based UI architecture
* **Vite** - Enables lightning-fast development workflow
* **Tailwind CSS** - Provides utility-first approach for responsive design
* **PrimeVue** - Offers elegant, professionally designed components
* **Axios** - Handles HTTP requests with elegant promise-based syntax
* **TypeScript** - Ensures code reliability through static typing

This carefully curated technology stack ensures a seamless user experience with fluid interactions and robust
client-server communication, all while maintaining modern design principles.
## Prerequisites

*   Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
*   Gradle (version specified in `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`)
*   Docker (for running MongoDB in a container during testing)
*   MongoDB instance (if not using Testcontainers)
